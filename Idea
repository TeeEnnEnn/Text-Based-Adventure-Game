The player has lived in a cave their whole life. The player lives in a small village in the cave. The player may live in the cave but it is clear that the player does not come from the cave. Compared to the other people that live in the cave the player has more muscle and a more well defined bone structure. The player has been in the cave for as long as they can remember, but the people of the cave could remember more. The player knows that they are different from the people of the cave but still treats them as their own. 

Tales have been told. Tales of a bright yellow ball that floats far above. Tales of a bright white ball that floats with many small white dots to accompany it. Tales of a vast expanse of land that is not confined by the dark walls of a cave. These are the tales that the character has grown up to. However the player has never left the cave. No one dares to try and leave the cave. There is only one way to leave the cave. It is treacherous and unforgiving. It holds many vicious beasts. No one can make it through. 

No one, except one man. An old man who many in the village call senile.
