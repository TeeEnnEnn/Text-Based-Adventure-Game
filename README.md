# Caver
### Text based adventure game
Text based adventure game in python based on concepts from the book "Make Your Own Python Text Adventure" by Phillip Johnson.

This project is aimed to culminate all that I have learnt in the python language up to this point. More projects like this will come once my knowledge of python grows.

This project is made using the object oriented paradigm in python

To play the game you can either: 
        1. Run "game.py" using the python launcher. 
        2. Run the "game.exe" file. 
        3. Compile the "game.py" file on your system and then run it.

When you play the game for the first time it will create a __pycache__ folder then close. If you reopen game.py it will create another folder named "caver". Once this folder has been created you are all good to play. Do your best not to delete the "caver" folder as doing so will result in your leaderboard data being lost. 

Before playing the game I reccomend that you read the player story and read the game help. 

I hope you enjoy
