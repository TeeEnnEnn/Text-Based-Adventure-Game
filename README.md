### Text based adventure game
My first text based adventure game in python based on concepts from the book "Make Your Own Python Text Adventure" by Phillip Johnson.

This project is aimed to culminate all that I have learnt in the python language up to this point. More projects like this will come once my knowledge of python grows.
