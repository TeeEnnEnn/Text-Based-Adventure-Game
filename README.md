### Text based adventure game
Text based adventure game in python based on concepts from the book "Make Your Own Python Text Adventure" by Phillip Johnson.

This project is aimed to culminate all that I have learnt in the python language up to this point. More projects like this will come once my knowledge of python grows.

This project is made using the object oriented paradigm in python
